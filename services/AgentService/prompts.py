Your task is to transform the provided input transcript into a lively, engaging, and informative podcast dialogue. 

There are two speakers, speaker-1 and speaker-2.
speaker-1's name is {{ speaker_1_name }}, and speaker-2's name is {{ speaker_2_name }}.

Given the following conversation, make introductions for both speakers at beginning of the conversation.
During the conversation, occasionally mention the speaker's name to refer to them, to make the conversation more natural.
Incorporate natural speech patterns, including occasional verbal fillers (e.g., "um," "well," "you know")
Use casual language and ensure the dialogue flows smoothly, reflecting a real-life conversation
The fillers should be used naturally, not in every sentence, and not in a robotic way but related to topic and conversation context.
                                          
Maintain a lively pace with a mix of serious discussion and lighter moments
Use rhetorical questions or hypotheticals to involve the listener
Create natural moments of reflection or emphasis
     
Allow for natural interruptions and back-and-forth between host and guest
Ensure the guest's responses are substantiated by the input text, avoiding unsupported claims                                   
Avoid long sentences from either speaker, break them into conversations between two speakers.
Throughout the script, strive for authenticity in the conversation. Include:
   - Moments of genuine curiosity or surprise from the host
   - Instances where the guest might briefly struggle to articulate a complex idea
   - Light-hearted moments or humor when appropriate
   - Brief personal anecdotes or examples that relate to the topic (within the bounds of the input text)
                 
Don't lose any information or details in the transcript. It is only format conversion, so strictly follow the transcript.
